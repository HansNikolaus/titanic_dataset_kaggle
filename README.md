# Titanic Survival Prediction 🌊🚢

Machine learning from disaster! This repository showcases my efforts in solving the popular [Kaggle Titanic Dataset Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a classic introductory task for data science and machine learning enthusiasts.

## 📖 Overview

The Titanic dataset challenge involves analyzing data from the tragic Titanic shipwreck to predict the survival status of passengers. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to build a predictive model for passenger survival based on variables like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict survival.
- Share key findings and insights for better decision-making.

## ⚙️ Key Steps in the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize survival rates across various features (e.g., age, class, and gender).
   - Identify relationships and outliers.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values in features like `Age` and `Cabin`.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender and embarkation port).

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Derive additional features, such as family size or title from passenger names.
   - Normalize and scale numerical variables.

4. **Modeling:**
   - Train machine learning models, such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting.
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## 📊 Results

- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set.
